The files uploaded in this GitHub Repository are the only ones needed to create the _openFrameworks_ project. Simply download the repository and drag the folder to the _openFrameworks_ project generator. However, in order for this project to work properly it also needs a Kinect V1 Sensor. Otherwise, the hand detection will not be possible. \
