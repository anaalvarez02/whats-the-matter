# whats-the-matter
Here is the code for my final piece for the course _IS52055A: Digital Arts Project 2_ at Goldsmiths, University of London. \
\
This project is an interactive, screen-based reimagining of a creation myth, but with a twist. Instead of the separation of matter, I’m presenting its entanglement as the reason for existence. This concept is based off Lynn Margulis’ Symbiogenesis Theory. It was presented at the Bargehouse Gallery in the exhibition _Ephemerence,_ the 2022 Digital Arts Computing Degree Show.

The files uploaded in this GitHub Repository are the only ones needed to create the _openFrameworks_ project. Simply download the repository and drag the folder to the _openFrameworks_ project generator. However, in order for this project to work properly it also needs a Kinect V1 Sensor. Otherwise, the hand detection will not be possible. \

Here are some links to WIP videos as well as the resulting installation at the 2022 DAC Degree Show _Ephemerence_.
